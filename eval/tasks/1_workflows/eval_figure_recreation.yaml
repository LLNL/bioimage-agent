# Figure Recreation Tests for napari-mcp
# These tests evaluate the agent's ability to recreate scientific figures from papers
# Focus: Loading data, applying appropriate visualization settings, and matching target figures

#Test: Recreate a figure from a dataset.

    question: |
      Load the dataset into napari: data/dataset_001/dataset_001.tiff
      Read the target figure: data/dataset_001/dataset_001.png but don't load it into napari.
      Read the dataset description: data/dataset_001/dataset_001.yaml. 
      Set the same colormaps and blending modes as the target figure.
      Adjust contrast and gamma as needed to match the target figure.
      Take a screenshot of your recreation.
      If the recreation does not match the target figure, adjust the visualization settings and take a screenshot again.
      Stop when the recreation matches the target figure or you have tried five different visualization settings.
      Respond with <1> if you successfully recreated the figure and it closely matches the target, or <0> if it failed or doesn't match well. Only respond with <1> or <0>.
