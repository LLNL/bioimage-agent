# Test: Iso surface determination for a target
- vars:
    question: |
      Read the file "data/dataset_003/eval_iso_surface_determination_target_1.txt" to get the target iso-surface values for different tooth structures.
      Load data/dataset_003\dataset_003.tif into napari. 
      Switch to 3D view mode and set the rendering to iso. 
      Find the iso surface value that shows the target clearly.
      Rotate the camera to several angles and take a screenshot of the result each time to check if the target structure is clearly visible from different angles.
      If the target structure is not clearly visible, adjust the iso surface value and take a screenshot again.
      Stop when the target structure is clearly visible or you have tried five different iso surface values.
      Respond with <1> if you clearly see the target structure, or <0> if you cannot see the target structure. Only respond with <1> or <0>.
  assert:
    - type: contains-all
